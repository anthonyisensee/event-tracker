# Event Tracker

Event tracker is the modern equivalent of the "It has been <u>&nbsp;X&nbsp;</u> days since the last accident" whiteboard. It is designed to help you easily visualize the time since an event has occurred by allowing you to create custom trackers and log events against them.

## Development

To begin developing:

* If you intend to submit a pull request fork the repo.
* Clone the repo (or forked repo) to your local machine.
* Install npm or verify that it has already been installed using `npm -v`.
* Run `npm i` in the project directory to install dependencies.
* Run the project with `npm start`.

## Deployment

Event Tracker automatically deploys code pushed to the prod branch.
